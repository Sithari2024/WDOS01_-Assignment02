The island's woodland patches, tea farms, grasslands, home gardens, and plantations of pine and eucalyptus are just a few of the places where it can be found. Living alone, they hunt primarily at night and may carry their kills into trees. They warn intruders by making sounds like growls, snarls, meows, and purrs, as well as by leaving claw marks. Cats that are melanistic are uncommon. With 750â€“1,000 leopards in the population, Sri Lanka has one of the highest populations of leopards worldwide. Leopard populations are well-known in the Yala and Wilpattu national parks. Leopards are threatened by poaching, habitat degradation, and conflicts with other species even though they are protected. Their long-term survival depends on conservation initiatives including habitat protection and community involvement. In order to better understand leopard behavior and put into practice successful conservation initiatives, researchers and conservationists keep an eye on the leopard population. Even though they have been classified as a \"endangered\" species since 2008, leopards are still visible across Sri Lanka."

Addressing the underlying causes of habitat loss, such as unsustainable development and land use practices, necessitates working with legislators and stakeholders to implement rules. Other strategies include establishing protected areas, applying sustainable forestry methods, recovering degraded forests, encouraging coexistence, and enhancing wildlife corridor management."
