It is controlled by the Department of Wildlife Conservation and covers Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, as well as Mannar and Vavuniya. The park is home to the elusive Sri Lankan leopard and sloth bear, as well as deep forest cover and the distinctive Villu wetlands. The park is near the ancient historical city of Anuradhapura and contains numerous ancient remains and artifacts. The park is famous for its leopard population, with a remote camera survey collecting images of 49 different leopards. The park was closed owing to security concerns during the Sri Lankan Civil War but reopened 16 years later. The park's history goes back to 543 BC when Prince Vijaya established the Sinhalese kingdom at Tambapanni."

The project also seeks to encourage sustainable use of marine resources by negotiating voluntary renunciation of damaging resource usage with fishermen and cooperatives. The project also intends to promote access to long-term economic prospects through village development plans and compensation programs. The project also aims to increase environmental awareness and promote peaceful coexistence. Wilpattu National Park, which had previously been closed owing to civil upheaval, reopened in 2010 and has since been a priority region for environmental conservation and rural development."
