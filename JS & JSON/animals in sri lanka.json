    "h1": "The Wildlife Tapestry of Sri Lanka: Exploring the Habitats and Preserving Indigenous Species",
    "p": "There is a wide variety of flora and fauna in Sri Lanka, such as lizards, turtles, tortoises, monitors, snakes, crocodiles, and 526 birds. These creatures are threatened by global warming and increasing urbanisation, which is why the IUCN has listed some of them on its 'red list' of critically endangered species. For an animal to be included on this list, it must have lost less than 80% of its population within the last ten years and have less than 250 members in a given area. According to research, the Northern and Eastern provinces have lower levels of urbanisation and human density, which lessens the threat to severely endangered animals. It is possible to stop extinction by enacting laws that penalise poaching, deforestation, urban planning, and environmental respect. Among the significant wildlife reserves are Wilpattu National Park and Yala National Park."

      "p": "Based on their diet of crustacean krill, blue whales—the biggest mammals on Earth—are found all over the world. In the deep ocean, their low-frequency sounds can reach hundreds of kilometres, and their maximum length is 30 metres, and their highest weight is 170 tonnes. In order to guarantee their survival, the Sri Lankan Wildlife Department is working."

Programmes for wildlife corridors, habitat restoration, and conflict mediation are being implemented by conservation organisations in collaboration with local administrations and communities. The largest land mammal, the Asian elephant, is a cultural emblem in Asia."
