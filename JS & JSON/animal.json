    "title": "The Wildlife Tapestry of Sri Lanka: Exploring the Habitats and Preserving Indigenous Species",
    "content": "There is a wide variety of flora and fauna in Sri Lanka, such as lizards, turtles, tortoises, monitors, snakes, crocodiles, and 526 birds. These creatures are threatened by global warming and increasing urbanisation, which is why the IUCN has listed some of them on its \"red list\" of critically endangered species. For an animal to be included on this list, it must have lost less than 80% of its population within the last ten years and have less than 250 members in a given area. According to research, the Northern and Eastern provinces have lower levels of urbanisation and human density, which lessens the threat to severely endangered animals. It is possible to stop extinction by enacting laws that penalise poaching, deforestation, urban planning, and environmental respect. Among the significant wildlife reserves are Wilpattu National Park, Yala National Park, and Udawalawe National."
