    "content": "Explore the wildlife of Sri Lanka and its abundant biodiversity and natural beauty. The island is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, from pristine beaches to lush jungles. The remarkable diversity of ecosystems that sustain a wide range of wildlife species is facilitated by Sri Lanka's distinct physical features, which include mountains, plains, and coastal regions. A third or so of Sri Lanka's territory is covered with natural vegetation. In much of the nation, forests make up the climax vegetation—that is, the natural flora allowed to grow unhindered. Tropical wet evergreen forests predominate in the lowlands of the Wet Zone, while submontane and montane evergreen forests do so in the highlands. The climax vegetation of the Dry Zone is made up of moist deciduous and dry evergreen forests, with the woods giving place to a stunted, shrubby, xerophytic (drought-tolerant) vegetation in its driest areas. Grasslands and scant woodlands are common in the Central Highlands' highest altitudes."

    "title": "The Wildlife Tapestry of Sri Lanka: Exploring the Habitats and Preserving Indigenous Species",
    "content": "There is a wide variety of flora and fauna in Sri Lanka, such as lizards, turtles, tortoises, monitors, snakes, crocodiles, and 526 birds. These creatures are threatened by global warming and increasing urbanisation, which is why the IUCN has listed some of them on its \"red list\" of critically endangered species. For an animal to be included on this list, it must have lost less than 80% of its population within the last ten years and have less than 250 members in a given area. According to research, the Northern and Eastern provinces have lower levels of urbanisation and human density, which lessens the threat to severely endangered animals. It is possible to stop extinction by enacting laws that penalise poaching, deforestation, urban planning, and environmental respect. Among the significant wildlife reserves are Wilpattu National Park, Yala National Park, and Udawalawe National."

Visitation to the park climbed from 43,368 in 2008 to 545,007 in 2015, representing a 1000% increase in seven years. This has resulted in an average of 250 automobiles entering Yala Block 1 per day, with higher numbers during the holiday season. To address this over-visitation, the Prime Minister's office formed the 'Yala Sub-Committee' to develop a long-term management strategy. The key stakeholders in this Sub-Committee are the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Tourist Board. In March 2017, an action plan for improving the wildlife tourism experience in Yala National Park was developed, which included short-term, medium-term, and long-term initiatives. The strategy calls for wildlife conservation, anti-poaching measures, habitat restoration, community involvement, research and monitoring, and tourism management. The goal is to reduce tourism's environmental impact while allowing visitors to appreciate and learn about the park's natural features."

The project also seeks to encourage sustainable use of marine resources by negotiating voluntary renunciation of damaging resource usage with fishermen and cooperatives. The project also intends to promote access to long-term economic prospects through village development plans and compensation programs. The project also aims to increase environmental awareness and promote peaceful coexistence.
