    "content": "Explore the wildlife of Sri Lanka and its abundant biodiversity and natural beauty. The island is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, from pristine beaches to lush jungles. The remarkable diversity of ecosystems that sustain a wide range of wildlife species is facilitated by Sri Lanka's distinct physical features, which include mountains, plains, and coastal regions. A third or so of Sri Lanka's territory is covered with natural vegetation. In much of the nation, forests make up the climax vegetationâ€”that is, the natural flora allowed to grow unhindered. Tropical wet evergreen forests predominate in the lowlands of the Wet Zone, while submontane and montane evergreen forests do so in the highlands. The climax vegetation of the Dry Zone is made up of moist deciduous and dry evergreen forests, with the woods giving place to a stunted, shrubby, xerophytic (drought-tolerant) vegetation in its driest areas. Grasslands and scant woodlands are common in the Central Highlands' highest altitudes."
